# Templater Community Plugin

Like the _Templates core plugin_, the Obsidian community has developed a free plugin called _Templater_ that goes well beyond the capabilities of the core plugin in providing many advanced techniques for templating in Obsidian. The good news is that these plugins are compatible, so what you learn in the Templates core plugin will apply to Templater. However, the Templater plugin goes much further. If you are interested in advanced templating techniques that give you templating superpowers, be sure to check out the document for this plugin: [Templater community plugin documentation](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/).

The technique for inserting the Date and Time into a template, as described in [[3 - Templates Core Plugin]] document, also works with the Templater plugin.

Additionally, these YouTube tutorials from the Obsidian community are a good starting point:
