# Daily Notes Core Plugin

Obsidian includes one additional plugin that many journalers love to use. It is called the Daily notes plugin. This also needs to be enabled in settings.

## Purpose
This plugin automatically creates a new note each day when Obsidian starts up. Many journalers use this plugin, along with a journaling template they like to use daily, to automatically create a new note each day based on that template. This saves you a little time each day, so you can quickly get into journaling and skip over all the time-consuming setup for daily journaling. For the official documentation for this core plugin, check out this [link.](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes)

## Configuring Daily Notes for JournalCraft

Configure the Daily Notes plugin in Settings > Daily notes to work seamlessly with your JournalCraft templates:

1. **Date format**: Use YYYY-MM-DD for easy chronological sorting or some other format based on the naming suggestions in [[3 - Templates Core Plugin#Guidance on Naming Files]]
2. **New file location**: Set this to a dedicated "Journal" folder in your vault. Keep in mind the suggestions in [[3 - Templates Core Plugin#Using Folders for Organization]].
3. **Template file location**: Choose one of JournalCraft's templates, such as the "5-Minute Morning Kickstart" or "Daily Highlights and Lowlights".
4. **Open daily note on startup**: Enable this to make journaling the first thing you do when you open Obsidian

## Using Daily Notes with JournalCraft

### Creating Today's Journal Entry

- Click the "Open today's daily note" icon in the left sidebar.
- Use the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for "Daily notes: Open today's daily note".

Each method will create a new note using your chosen JournalCraft template.

### Creating Entries for Other Dates

1. Open the [Calendar plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=calendar) (if enabled).
2. Click on any date to create or open a daily note for that day using your JournalCraft template.

## Usage with JournalCraft Templates

### Customizing Your JournalCraft Daily Template

1. Choose a JournalCraft template that suits your daily journaling style
2. Copy it to your vault and modify it if needed to fit your specific journaling needs
3. In Settings > Daily notes, set the "Template file location" to your customized JournalCraft template

### Date Formatting in Templates

JournalCraft templates can use the `{{date}}` and `{{time}}` placeholders. The Daily Notes plugin will automatically replace these with the current date and time when creating a new note. See [[2 - Customizing the JournalCraft Templates#Date Property]] for more information on configuring these placeholders.

### Combining JournalCraft Templates

You can use multiple JournalCraft templates in your daily notes:
1. Set up your main daily template (e.g., "5-Minute Morning Kickstart").
2. Use the Templates plugin to insert additional JournalCraft templates as needed (e.g., "Gratitude Journal" or "Stress and Anxiety Relief") to create one mega template.

## Best Practices for Journaling with JournalCraft and Daily Notes

1. **Consistency**: Aim to write in your daily note every day, even if briefly.
2. **Flexibility**: Use different JournalCraft templates as needed based on your daily experiences.
3. **Review**: Regularly review past entries to track personal growth and patterns.
4. **Evolve**: Adjust your daily template or journaling approach as your needs change.

Remember, JournalCraft templates are designed to make journaling easier and more insightful. The Daily Notes plugin helps you maintain this practice consistently. Experiment with different JournalCraft templates and Daily Notes settings to find the perfect combination for your journaling routine.
