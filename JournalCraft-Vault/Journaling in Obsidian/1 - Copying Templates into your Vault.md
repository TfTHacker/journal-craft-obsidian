## Copy the File through the System File Browser

You can use your operating system's file manager to copy a file from this vault to your personal vault. To do this, 

1. In the files pane, select the template from this vault that you want to copy to your vault
2. Right-click on it and select "Reveal in finder" (The name of this command will be slightly different on your platform)
3. The file will be displayed in the operating system's file manager. From there, you can copy it and paste it to a location in your vault.

# Use Source Mode to Copy and Paste the Template

Additionally, you can copy and paste the text from the template. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the template in the JournalCraft vault that you want to copy into your vault.
2. Using the command palette, select the **Toggle Live Preview/Source mode** command to switch into source mode. Source mode shows the raw text without any formatting.
3. Select all the text in the file.
4. Copy the selected text.
5. Going to your vault, create a new file to store your template and paste the clipboard into the new document.

The following video demonstrates using the Toggle Live Preview/Source mode command.
