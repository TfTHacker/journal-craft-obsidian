# Customizing the JournalCraft Templates

The templates included with JournalCraft are designed to be educational tools to help you learn various journaling techniques. However, you need to make the journaling templates meet your needs, so never be afraid to adjust them. This document provides several ideas about what can be customized with JournalCraft templates, along with customizing Obsidian.

## Prompts

Most templates include prompts that remind you how to use various sections of the journaling template. For example:

As you gain experience with the templates, these prompts may no longer be necessary to keep and can be removed from the template. However, we recommend in the beginning to keep them in the template until you can reliably remember them.

## Date Property

The JournalCraft templates often use a _Date_ [property](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) to capture the date and time of each journal entry. When you copy the templates into your own vault, if you have not defined the _Date_ property as a Date or Date/Time [type](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties#Property+types), you will most likely want to change it to make handling dates easier. First, open any template in JournalCraft that has a _Date_ property, then change its type as shown in this video:

## Ratings
A few of the templates have a section for ratings. For example, in the [[Journaling Templates/Mood Tracker Template/Mood Tracker Instructions|Mood Tracker,]] you can rate your mood. By default, these ratings are in the main body of the template's text. However, the rating could be made into a property in the document under the Date property.  This is a personal preference, but some individuals like to have such data elements separated from the area where they write text.

To add this to the template, simply add a property to the template named _Mood Rating_ and set its [type](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties#Property+types) to Number. This is demonstrated in the following short video:
