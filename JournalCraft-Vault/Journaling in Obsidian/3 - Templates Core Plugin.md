# Templates Core Plugin

Obsidian includes a core plugin called _Templates_. While this is not required for journaling, many journalers like to use Obsidian's built-in tool to simplify working with templates, including journaling templates they use daily.

Even if you prefer to avoid plugins, we suggest you not skip learning this plugin. It is a core plugin, which means it is a part of Obsidian and is maintained by the Obsidian team. It is simple in what it does, but you will find it to be valuable in your journaling workflow. 

Once you learn the templating basics with the Templates Core Plugin, don't overlook the much more powerful Templater Community Plugin. We encourage you to take things one step at a time. So learn the _Templates Core Plugin_, use it, master it, and then move on to the [[5 - Templater Community Plugin]].

## Enable the Templates Core Plugin

To enable this template, open settings and select the _Core plugins_ tab. In that tab, toggle the _Templates_ plugin on.

Learn more about using this core plugin from the official Obsidian documentation at [Obsidian's help for the Templates core plugin.](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates)

## Using {{date}} and {{time}}

The Templates core plugin supports using variables to insert today's date and time. If you use this plugin, starting a new journal entry each day can be simplified. [Obsidian's Templates documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates) describes how to use variables in templates. If you want to use this feature, we suggest changing any template you use from this vault in the following way.

Change the template properties at the beginning of the template from this:

![[Media/other/Templates plugin - variables - 1.png|350]]
To this:
![[Media/other/Templates plugin - variables - 2.png|350]]

Using {{date}} variable, today's date will be inserted into the template when inserted into a document. Additionally, using the {{time}} variable, you can add the current time to the document.

Obsidian's documentation for template variables can be found at this [link.](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates#Template+variables)

In addition, Obsidian provides convenient and quick methods for inserting dates and times. This is also useful for journaling. Learn more from the following community resources:

## Using Templates to Create New Documents

Once you have set up your templates, you can easily create new documents based on them using the Templates core plugin. Here's how:

1. Create a new document where you want to insert the template.
2. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P).
3. Type "Template" and select "Templates: Insert template".
4. Choose the template you want to use from the list.
5. The template content will be inserted into your current document.

Alternatively, you can set up a hotkey for quick template insertion:

1. Go to Settings > Hotkeys.
2. Search for "Templates: Insert template".
3. Assign a hotkey of your choice.

Now, you can use this hotkey to quickly insert a template into any document.

## Guidance on Naming Files

Consistent and meaningful file naming helps organize your journal entries effectively. Here are some tips for naming your files:

1. Use a consistent date format:
   - YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2023-07-15) is recommended as it sorts chronologically.
   - You can add the day of the week if desired (e.g., 2023-07-15 Saturday).

2. Include the type of journal entry:
   - For example: "2023-07-15 Daily Reflection" or "2023-07-15 Gratitude Journal".

3. Avoid special characters:
   - Stick to letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores to ensure compatibility across different systems.

4. Be concise but descriptive:
   - "2023-07-15 Project Brainstorm" is better than just "2023-07-15-ideas".
   - But don't overcomplicate file naming. Always remember: focus on journaling without getting bogged down in technical details.

5. Consider using a naming convention for recurring entries:
   - For daily entries: "YYYY-MM-DD-daily"
   - For weekly reflections: "YYYY-WW-weekly-reflection" (where WW is the week number)
   - For monthly reviews: "YYYY-MM-monthly-review"

6. If you're using the [[4 - Daily Notes Core Plugin]], you can set up a custom filename format in the plugin settings to automatically name your daily entries.

Remember, the key is to choose a naming convention that makes sense to you and stick with it consistently. This will make it easier to find and organize your journal entries over time.

## Using Folders for Organization

Folders can be a powerful tool for organizing your journal entries. Here are some suggestions for using folders effectively:

1. Create a main "Journal" folder:
   - This keeps all your journal entries in one place.
2. Use year folders:
   - Create folders for each year (e.g., "2023", "2024") to easily navigate to entries from specific years.
3. Consider monthly subfolders:
   - Within each year folder, you could have monthly folders (e.g., "01-January", "02-February") for more granular organization.
4. Create topic-based folders:
   - For specific types of entries, consider folders like "Gratitude", "Personal Reflections", or "Goal Tracking".
5. Use a "Templates" folder:
   - Keep all your journal templates in a dedicated folder for easy access and management.
6. Consider a "Media" folder:
   - If you include images or other media in your journals, a separate folder can help keep these organized.
7. Implement a flat structure for daily entries:
   - For daily journals, you might prefer keeping all entries in a single folder for easy chronological browsing.
8. Use Obsidian's [tagging](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags) system:
   - [Tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags) can complement your folder structure, allowing for flexible, cross-folder organization.

Remember, the best folder structure is one that aligns with your thinking process and makes it easy for you to find and manage your journal entries. Don't be afraid to experiment and adjust your system as your journaling practice evolves.

We want to repeat the advice we gave earlier: **focus on journaling without getting bogged down in technical details.** Sadly, it is too easy to get sucked into constantly tweaking the technical aspects of their vault that they miss the main point of using Obsidian, which is to write notes. Keep it balanced so you can benefit from writing and enjoy using Obsidian.
