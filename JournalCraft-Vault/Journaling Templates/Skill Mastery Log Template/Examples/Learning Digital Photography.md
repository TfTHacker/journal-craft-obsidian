**Next Steps:**
- Move on to understanding shutter speed.

# 2022-10-05
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 3.5 hours
- Focus Areas: Shutter speed, capturing motion, panning technique

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Difficulty achieving sharp images in low light. Solution: Learned about minimum handheld shutter speed rule (1/focal length).
- Struggled with panning technique. Solution: Practiced smooth body rotation and experimented with different shutter speeds.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Captured a clear image of a moving car without motion blur using a fast shutter speed (1/1000s).
- Successfully created a panning shot of a cyclist, keeping the subject sharp while blurring the background to convey motion.
- Learned the creative potential of slow shutter speeds: captured light trails from car headlights (30-second exposure) and created a misty effect on a waterfall (1-second exposure).

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with intentional motion blur for creative effects.
- Practice more panning shots with various subjects (runners, cars, animals).
- Explore long exposure photography further, possibly investing in ND filters.

**Reflections:**
Today's session was particularly enlightening. I realized that shutter speed is not just a technical aspect but a powerful creative tool. The panning technique opened up a whole new world of possibilities â€“ it's challenging but the results are rewarding. I'm excited to explore how different shutter speeds can convey various moods and stories in my images.

# 2022-10-08
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 3 hours
- Focus Areas: ISO, low light photography

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- High ISO resulting in noisy images. Solution: Learned noise reduction techniques in post-processing.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Found the balance between acceptable noise and correct exposure in low light.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin combining aperture, shutter speed, and ISO in manual mode.

# 2022-10-10
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 2.5 hours
- Focus Areas: Manual mode, metering modes

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Overwhelmed trying to adjust all settings at once. Solution: Practiced the "expose for highlights" technique.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Successfully used manual mode to capture a well-exposed sunset scene.

**Next Steps:**
- Learn about white balance and color temperature.

# 2022-10-12
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 2 hours
- Focus Areas: White balance, color temperature

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Inconsistent colors across different lighting scenarios. Solution: Used custom white balance for tricky lighting situations.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Able to correct color casts in-camera using appropriate white balance settings.

**Next Steps:**
- Explore composition techniques, starting with the rule of thirds.

# 2022-10-15
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 5 hours
- Focus Areas: Composition techniques - rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, patterns, framing

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Difficulty seeing potential compositions in everyday scenes. Solution: Practiced using a cardboard frame to isolate compositions before shooting.
- Tendency to always place subjects dead center. Solution: Enabled rule of thirds grid in camera viewfinder as a guide.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Successfully applied rule of thirds to landscape and portrait shots, creating more balanced and interesting images.
- Identified and used leading lines to create more dynamic images, guiding the viewer's eye through the frame.
- Discovered the power of symmetry in architectural photography, creating striking images of building facades.
- Found and captured repeating patterns in nature and urban environments, adding visual interest to otherwise ordinary scenes.
- Used natural elements (tree branches, archways) as frames to add depth and focus to landscape shots.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue practicing composition, explore negative space and color theory.
- Begin learning about different types of lenses and their uses.
- Start a photo series applying these composition techniques to a specific theme or location.

**Reflections:**
Today's extended session was a game-changer. I feel like I've begun to see the world differently, noticing potential photographs everywhere. The rule of thirds has helped me break away from centering everything, and I'm amazed at how much more professional my images look already. 

Finding leading lines was challenging at first, but after some practice, I started seeing them everywhere - in roads, rivers, even in the way people were standing in a queue. It's fascinating how these lines can create a sense of depth and movement in a 2D image.

The concept of framing was particularly enjoyable to experiment with. Using a natural arch to frame a distant mountain produced one of my favorite shots of the day. It's incredible how this technique can transform a good shot into a great one by adding context and depth.

I also learned that composition isn't just about following rules, but about using these principles as tools to convey the story or emotion I want to capture. Sometimes intentionally breaking these 'rules' can lead to powerful images.

Moving forward, I want to focus on making these composition techniques second nature, so I can apply them instinctively in the field. I'm excited to see how my photography evolves as I continue to practice and refine these skills.

# 2022-10-18
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 2.5 hours
- Focus Areas: Negative space, natural framing

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Tendency to overcrowd the frame. Solution: Consciously looked for minimalist compositions and practiced leaving empty space.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Created a series of images using natural elements as frames.

**Next Steps:**
- Begin learning about different types of lenses and their uses.

# 2022-10-21
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 3 hours
- Focus Areas: Lens types, focal lengths

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Confusion about when to use different focal lengths. Solution: Spent time comparing the same scene shot at various focal lengths.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Understood how focal length affects perspective and composition.

**Next Steps:**
- Practice with different lenses, if available. Otherwise, experiment more with the zoom range of current lens.
- Begin exploring basic photo editing techniques.

# 2022-10-24
**Practice Session:**
- Duration: 4 hours
- Focus Areas: Introduction to Adobe Lightroom, basic editing techniques

**Challenges & Solutions:**
- Overwhelmed by the number of editing options. Solution: Focused on mastering a few basic adjustments first (exposure, contrast, white balance).
- Tendency to over-edit photos. Solution: Practiced restraint, aiming for natural-looking enhancements.

**Breakthroughs & Key Learnings:**
- Learned to use the histogram to evaluate and adjust exposure.
- Successfully color-corrected a series of photos taken under different lighting conditions.
- Discovered the power of local adjustments using the brush tool.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue practicing basic editing techniques.
- Learn about exporting options for different uses (web, print).

**Reflections:**
Post-processing is opening up a whole new dimension to my photography. I'm realizing that capturing the image is only half the journey; how I develop it can significantly impact the final result. The ability to fine-tune exposure and color has already improved several photos I thought were mediocre.

I'm particularly excited about local adjustments. Being able to brighten just a subject's face or enhance the color of a specific element in the image feels almost magical. However, I need to be cautious not to overdo it. I'm learning that subtlety is key in creating natural-looking edits.

The histogram has been a revelation. It's helping me understand exposure in a more technical way, and I can already see how this knowledge will improve my in-camera skills as well.
