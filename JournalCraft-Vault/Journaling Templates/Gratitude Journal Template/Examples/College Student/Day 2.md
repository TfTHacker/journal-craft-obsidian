# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The unexpected cancellation of my early morning class, allowing me to catch up on sleep
2. The group project meeting that went surprisingly well and efficiently
3. Finding a forgotten granola bar in my backpack when I was hungry during a long study session

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my childhood friend, Jamie, who called to check in on me. Talking to someone who knows me outside of the college context helped me feel grounded and remembered.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I finally worked up the courage to speak up in my seminar class today. Even though my heart was racing, I contributed to the discussion and my point was well-received.

# Nature's Beauty

- There was a brief rain shower this afternoon. The sound of rain pattering against the library windows created a cozy atmosphere that made studying a bit more enjoyable.

# Unexpected Positive

- I bumped into a classmate at the gym and we ended up having a great conversation. It was nice to connect with someone outside of class and realize we have more in common than just our major.

# Gratitude Reflection

- After a week of keeping this gratitude journal, I'm noticing a shift in my perspective. While college is still challenging, I'm becoming more aware of the positive aspects of my day. This practice is helping me maintain a bit of optimism even when I'm feeling stressed about academics.
