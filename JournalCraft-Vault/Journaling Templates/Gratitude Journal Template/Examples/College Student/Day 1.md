# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The extra-large coffee my roommate surprised me with this morning
2. Finding a quiet corner in the library to focus on my studying
3. The understanding professor who granted me a short extension on my paper

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my study group partner, Alex. They explained a difficult concept in our Physics class in a way that finally made sense to me. Their patience and clear explanations are lifesavers.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I actually made it to my 8 AM class on time today, despite wanting to sleep in. It's a small win, but it helped me start the day on the right foot.

# Nature's Beauty

- On my way to class, I noticed a patch of wildflowers growing near the science building. Their bright colors against the brick wall were a cheerful sight that lifted my mood.

# Unexpected Positive

- The vending machine gave me two snacks instead of one when I was stress-eating before my exam. It felt like the universe was giving me a tiny high-five.

# Gratitude Reflection

- Even though I'm feeling overwhelmed with coursework, taking a moment to write down these positive things has helped me realize that not everything is as bad as it seems. There are still good moments in each day, even if they're small.
