# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The campus mental health services offering free meditation sessions
2. My laptop battery lasting through my entire study session at the caf√©
3. Finding my favorite comfort snack at the convenience store when I needed a pick-me-up

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my roommate, Sam. They noticed I was stressed and did my share of the chores without being asked. It was a small gesture but it meant a lot.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I reached out to a classmate to form a study group for our upcoming midterm. It was anxiety-inducing to ask, but I'm proud of myself for taking initiative.

# Nature's Beauty

- During my walk to class, I noticed a squirrel meticulously burying an acorn. Watching its focused determination was oddly inspiring and made me smile.

# Unexpected Positive

- The professor randomly called on me in class, and I actually knew the answer! It boosted my confidence and made me feel like maybe I am learning something after all.

# Gratitude Reflection

- This gratitude practice is helping me recognize that even on tough days, there are moments of kindness, beauty, and small victories. It's making the college experience feel a bit less overwhelming.
