# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. My daughter Emma's contagious laughter during our pillow fight this evening
2. The new coffee maker I treated myself to - the first cup was heavenly!
3. Successfully finishing a custom order for my side business ahead of schedule

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson. She watched the kids for an hour while I had an important client call. Her kindness made my day so much smoother.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I finally organized my craft supplies for my business. It's a small thing, but it will save me so much time and stress going forward.

# Nature's Beauty

- The sunset this evening was spectacular - all pink and gold. Watching it with the kids on the porch was a perfect moment of peace in our busy day.

# Unexpected Positive

- My son Jack, who usually struggles with math, came home excited about acing his math quiz. His pride and joy were infectious!

# Gratitude Reflection

- Taking time to write this entry has helped me realize how many good things happened today, even though it felt hectic. I'm going to bed feeling more content and appreciative.
