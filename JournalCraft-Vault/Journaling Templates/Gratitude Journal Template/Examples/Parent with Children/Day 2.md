# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The quiet hour I had this morning before the kids woke up
2. The supportive comment a customer left on my business's social media page
3. Finding $20 in the pocket of my old jeans - a nice little surprise!

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my sister today. She called just to check in and ended up giving me some great advice about balancing work and family.

# Personal Accomplishment

- Despite the busy day, I managed to squeeze in a 20-minute workout. It wasn't much, but it made me feel good about prioritizing my health.

# Nature's Beauty

- The jasmine in our backyard is in full bloom. Its sweet scent filled the air while I was hanging laundry, making a chore feel like a treat.

# Unexpected Positive

- My youngest, Lily, spontaneously helped her brother clean up his toys without being asked. It was heartwarming to see them cooperate.

# Gratitude Reflection

- Writing these entries is helping me notice more positive moments throughout the day. I find myself mentally noting things to be grateful for, which makes even challenging days feel more balanced.
