# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The kids' excitement about starting their summer vacation
2. A sudden burst of creativity that led to a new product idea for my business
3. The leftovers in the fridge that made an easy dinner on a busy day

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my oldest son, Jack. He noticed I was stressed and offered to help with dinner. His thoughtfulness and growing maturity touched my heart.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I finally made that doctor's appointment I've been putting off. It's a small step, but it feels good to take care of my health.

# Nature's Beauty

- We had a brief summer rain this afternoon. The fresh, earthy smell afterward and the way the plants seemed to perk up were beautiful.

# Unexpected Positive

- An old client reached out for a repeat order, larger than the last one. It's a welcome boost for my business that I wasn't expecting.

# Gratitude Reflection

- I've noticed that focusing on gratitude is helping me stay calmer during chaotic moments. Today, when the kids were arguing, I was able to take a deep breath and remember the good parts of the day instead of getting frustrated.
