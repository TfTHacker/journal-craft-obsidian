# Three Things I'm Grateful For

1. The peaceful early morning walk I took alone before the house woke up
2. The encouraging feedback from a customer about my products
3. Finding a great deal on art supplies for the kids' summer projects

# Person I'm Grateful For

- I'm grateful for my friend Sarah. She listened without judgment when I needed to vent about some parenting struggles, and her support made me feel less alone.

# Personal Accomplishment

- I stepped out of my comfort zone and did a live video to promote my business on social media. It was nerve-wracking, but I'm proud I did it!

# Nature's Beauty

- We spotted a beautiful butterfly in the garden today. Watching it flit from flower to flower with the kids was a moment of pure joy and wonder.

# Unexpected Positive

- Lily, my youngest, drew a picture of our family, including a representation of my small business. It was touching to see how she views my work as part of our family life.

# Gratitude Reflection

- This gratitude journal is becoming a cherished part of my day. It's helping me end each day on a positive note, regardless of any challenges. I'm noticing more moments of joy and feeling more resilient when things get tough.
