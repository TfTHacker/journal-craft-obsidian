- "Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

# Personal Reflections

- Clear's approach to habit formation is refreshingly practical and backed by science. I've always struggled with maintaining good habits, but the concept of "atomic habits" has given me a new perspective. I've started implementing some of the strategies, like habit stacking and environment design, and I'm already seeing small improvements in my daily routines. The idea that habits shape identity is particularly powerful and has made me more mindful of my daily actions.

# Rating

- 5/5 stars

# Next Reading Goal

- I'd like to explore more about the psychology behind habits and decision-making. "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg might be a good complement to this book.
