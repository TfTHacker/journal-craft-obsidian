- "The world is always ending for someone."

# Personal Reflections

- Yanagihara's ambitious novel spanning three centuries was a challenging but rewarding read. The interconnected narratives exploring alternate histories and dystopian futures were both thought-provoking and emotionally intense. I found myself deeply invested in each set of characters, even as the book's structure sometimes left me disoriented. The themes of love, identity, and the search for belonging resonated strongly with me, particularly in the context of our current global challenges.

# Rating

- 4.5/5 stars

# Next Reading Goal

- After this epic, I'm interested in exploring more speculative fiction that examines social issues. Perhaps Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Sower" next.
