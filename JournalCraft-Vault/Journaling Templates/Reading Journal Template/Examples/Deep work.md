# Personal Reflections

- Newport's concept of deep work has significantly changed my approach to my professional life. I realized how much time I was losing to shallow work and constant distractions. Implementing some of the suggested strategies, like scheduling deep work blocks and creating a "shutdown ritual," has already improved my productivity and reduced my stress levels. The book has also made me more aware of the value of my attention and has inspired me to be more intentional about how I spend my time both at work and in my personal life.

# Rating

# Next Reading Goal

- I'm interested in exploring more about minimalism and focus in the digital age. "Digital Minimalism," also by Cal Newport, seems like a natural next step.
