# Favorite Quotes

- "You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them."
- "The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self."
- "My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs."

# Personal Reflections

- Westover's journey from a isolated upbringing to Cambridge University is both inspiring and heart-wrenching. Her story made me reflect on my own education and the opportunities I've had. It also made me think about the complex nature of family relationships and how we define ourselves in relation to our upbringing. The book has given me a new appreciation for the power of education to open up new worlds and perspectives. It's also sparked some introspection about my own family dynamics and the beliefs I may have accepted without question.

# Rating

- 5/5 stars

# Next Reading Goal

- After reading "Educated," I'm interested in exploring more memoirs that deal with overcoming adversity and the pursuit of education. Perhaps "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls would be a good next read.
